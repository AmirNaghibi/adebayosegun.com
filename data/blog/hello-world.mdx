## Why Do You Need A Portfolio?

One of my main takeaways from researching the programming portfolio was the resistance of creating one. A lot of programmers feel it’s unnecessary, extra work they don’t need to do. What they’re missing (and what becomes your opportunity) is the most important thing. You have the chance to **stand out**. Let’s use this example.

```js:styles.jsx {1,3-4} showLineNumbers
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' });
  }
}
```

As of their 2015 filing with the SEC, there were [over 23,000 employees in R&D](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000165204416000012/goog10-k2015.htm) at Google. One source states that on average, Google hires [1 employee out of every 130 applicants](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/blog/google-averages-130-applicants-to-make-one-hire/), or about 0.7%. In his book titled _Work Rules_, Google’s SVP (Senior Vice President) of People Operations (basically Human Resources) states:

> “We receive more than two million applications every year. [...] Of these, Google hires only several thousand per year, making Google twenty-five times more selective than Harvard, Yale, or Princeton.”

Based on that example, the acceptance rate is even lower - around 0.2 - 0.3%. This just reinstates the fact you need to stand out as much as possible. Taking initiative tends to be a trait employers appreciate in their employees, and creating a portfolio and distinguishing yourself from your peers is a step in the right direction. Creating a portfolio allows you to achieve a variety of things that don’t translate to the typical resume:

- **Show your code off!** If you’re trying to achieve a sought after job, you probably have spent some time creating projects to learn how to code. Whether that was for fun or for school work, hopefully you have a few examples of your coding ability in existence.
- **Express your personality.** Your life and body of work is more than just a piece of paper. For a hiring manager to really get a good feel for you, they want to know the most fundamental question: would I enjoy working with this person? Your personality doesn’t always shine through your resume and ideally you want it to be an asset that gets you an interview. Your portfolio can help the employer get a better idea of how well you’ll fit in at their company, which also helps ensure you don’t take a job you’re not a good fit for.
- **Improve your online footprint.** A lot of employers judge your initial application based on the quality of your online footprint. Essentially, this just means what they find when they Google your name. They want to see relevant information about you. They don’t want to find your old MySpace profile filled with pictures of your cat. Regularly checking and working to improve your online footprint is a critical requirement for the software industry. Having a portfolio helps to ensure your best content is shown first.

The positive effects of a portfolio aren’t a newfound discovery, either. In her 2012 article in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/jobs/an-online-portfolio-can-showcase-your-work-career-couch.html), Eilene Zimmerman states:

> “One of the first things a recruiter or hiring manager does after receiving a promising lead is to search for the person on Google. Creating your own Web site or displaying your work on a larger platform gives you some control over what is found.”

Even software industry leaders are noticing a trend towards displaying your work online. One popular source is [GitHub](https://www.github.com), which allows applicants to display their projects and their contributions to open source software. John Resig, the creator of [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), a popular Javascript library, said:

> “When it comes to hiring, I'll take a GitHub commit log over a resume any day.”

Resig’s main point is that he values actual real world examples of a candidate's work rather than what they claim to do on paper. This is why popular sites such as [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) now allow you to link your GitHub profile on its careers page for applicants. Jeff Atwood, the co-founder of Stack Exchange (Stack Overflow’s parent company) even said this:

> “Just seeing what kind of work people have done, and what sort of online artifacts they've created, is tremendously helpful in getting a sense of what people do and what they're good (or bad) at.”

The bottom line is this: Hiring managers want tangible work. They want reassurance that you understand how to code and are a decent human being before they allocate the time and resources necessary to interview you. Your portfolio provides a platform for you to sell yourself to potential employers, including your most relevant and impressive work.

## Hosting, Deploying, and Securing

Let's deploy your portfolio! We'll be using git. Git allows you to track changes for your files and collaborate with others.
If you haven’t already, create a GitHub account. It's free and simple to deploy secure sites (and get your own URL) with Vercel.
You don't have to worry about setting up HTTPS or dealing with DNS records – it's all managed for you.

1. [Use this template](https://demo.vercel.blog/) (or choose your own git repo) to deploy your portfolio to [Vercel](http://vercel.com/).
2. Additionally, you can purchase a [custom domain](https://vercel.com/docs/custom-domains) and add it to your project.

Hopefully you found this post helpful and are on your way to creating a stunning portfolio! Feel free to [contact me](mailto:me@leerob.io) if you have any questions and share this post if you enjoyed it. Cheers!

### Skeleton Screens

Skeleton screens build anticipation for the content that is going to appear whereas loading spinners (and progress bars) put the focus on the wait time that the user has to endure. Apple has agreed with this idea enough to incorporate skeleton screens into their [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/icons-and-images/launch-screen/). They recommend displaying an outline of the initial application without text or any elements that will change. This can improve the feel of any action taking longer than a few hundred milliseconds.

### Building a Placeholder

First, let's create the base structure. In this example, the placeholder is supposed to represent a text area. We'll use [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) (Base - Element - Modifier) naming for our classes.

```html
<div class="text-input__loading">
  <div class="text-input__loading--line"></div>
  <div class="text-input__loading--line"></div>
  <div class="text-input__loading--line"></div>
  <div class="text-input__loading--line"></div>
  <div class="text-input__loading--line"></div>
  <div class="text-input__loading--line"></div>
  <div class="text-input__loading--line"></div>
  <div class="text-input__loading--line"></div>
  <div class="text-input__loading--line"></div>
  <div class="text-input__loading--line"></div>
</div>
```

We can use the newly created mixin to change the width of all 10 children `div` elements.

```css:styles.css
@include nth-children(1, 5, 9) {
  width: 150px;
}

@include nth-children(2, 6, 10) {
  width: 250px;
}

@include nth-children(3, 7) {
  width: 50px;
}

@include nth-children(4, 8) {
  width: 100px;
}
```
